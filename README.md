# Oh My Weight !
A simple Ionic &amp; Angular weight tracking app.

# What's this for ?

A simple personal project based on Ionic and that is not a todo app. I've checked up on the net ideas for apps and I stumbled about this simple concept that hopefully will make me able to practice more my skills on unit tests and developement on a more wide scope.

[The list is here](https://flaviocopes.com/sample-app-ideas/)

# Goals

* Accepts a set of manual entries of weight measurements taken at different dates
* Plot the user data a graph
* Store the data somewhere


# Contribute

You can contribute, fork or do whatever you like. You can also submit issues and give me feedback so I can improve myself because I'm sure of only one thing: "A day is wasted if we don't learn a new thing".

## How to get started?

You'll have to install ionic if it's not already the case. You can check [the instructions over here](https://ccoenraets.github.io/ionic-tutorial/install-ionic.html).
Once ionic & cordova installed, you can start the developement server with `npm start`.

You might encounter an error with SASS loading, if it's the case, start by installing **node-sass** as following :

`sudo npm install --save-dev`

Then you can run `npm start` and you'll be greeted with the dev server.
